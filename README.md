## Introduction 
The surge in spam emails leads to wasted time, security risks, and financial losses. To address this issue, companies rely on spam filters to automatically classify emails and minimize disruptions. 
Therefore, studying the key text features that influence whether an email is classified as spam is crucial. 
**Research Question** : 
Which text characteristics influence whether an email will be classified as spam or not?
The Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was applied to explore the most influential text characteristics affecting the spam emails.
